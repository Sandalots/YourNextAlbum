# Model Files Overview

This document describes the three main model files generated by the Album Recommendation System in the `models/` directory:

---

## 1. `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`

**Description:**

- Serialized scikit-learn TF-IDF vectorizer object.
- Used to transform album features and review text into TF-IDF vectors for similarity calculations.
- Enables fast and consistent feature extraction for recommendations.

---

## 2. `album_tfidf_matrix.pkl`

**Description:**

- Pickled sparse matrix containing TF-IDF vectors for all albums in the dataset.
- Each row represents an album, with columns corresponding to TF-IDF features.
- Used for efficient similarity search and recommendation.

---

## 3. `album_semantic_embeddings.npy`

**Description:**

- NumPy array containing semantic embeddings for each album, generated using a SentenceTransformer model.
- Captures contextual and nuanced meaning from album metadata and review text.
- Enables recommendations based on deeper semantic similarity, not just keyword overlap.

## How the Models Interact with the User Prompt

When a user enters a prompt (e.g., mood, theme, or album description), the system:

1. **TF-IDF Vectorizer** transforms the prompt and album features into comparable vectors.
2. **TF-IDF Matrix** is used to quickly compare the prompt vector to all albums for keyword-based similarity.
3. **Semantic Embeddings** allow the system to match the prompt to albums based on contextual meaning and nuanced language, improving recommendation relevance.

All three models work together to ensure recommendations are both fast (TF-IDF) and contextually accurate (semantic embeddings), leveraging both surface-level and deep text features.
