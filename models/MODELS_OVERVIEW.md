# Model Files Overview

This document describes the three main model files generated by the Album Recommendation System in the `models/` directory:

---

## 1. `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`
**Description:**
- Serialized scikit-learn TF-IDF vectorizer object.
- Used to transform album features and review text into TF-IDF vectors for similarity calculations.
- Enables fast and consistent feature extraction for recommendations.

---

## 2. `album_tfidf_matrix.pkl`
**Description:**
- Pickled sparse matrix containing TF-IDF vectors for all albums in the dataset.
- Each row represents an album, with columns corresponding to TF-IDF features.
- Used for efficient similarity search and recommendation.

---

## 3. `album_semantic_embeddings.npy`
**Description:**
- NumPy array of semantic embeddings for each album, generated using SentenceTransformer.
- Captures deeper semantic meaning from review text and features.
- Used for semantic search and matching user prompts to albums beyond keyword similarity.
